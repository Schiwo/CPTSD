## Abstract

Recent remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have accelerated their usage in various domains including healthcare, law, entertainment, to name a few. However, we have a lack of understanding on how to use LLMs for diagnosing mental health issues of patients. In this paper, we shed light on the intersection of mental health diagnosis and LLMs by conducting initial experiments. Specifically, we explore using LLMs for analyzing counseling data from North Korean defectors with mental health issues. We focused on the performance of LLMs on two sub-tasks: (1) extract key experiences and symptoms of the patients, write summaries of patient cases, and (2) infer evidence of mental health problems, such as highlighting specific sections within the counseling data. To assist in the training of LLMs, we propose a novel technique involving mental health specialists in data labeling, which has been shown to enhance the performance of LLMs. [TODO: add quantitative results which look promising, e.g.accuracy, ROC, mid-token distance.] This research contributes to the nascent field of applying LLMs to mental health diagnosis and demonstrates their potential effectiveness in aiding mental health practitioners
