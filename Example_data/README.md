## Data and Resources

To assist users in understanding the structure of the data, we have provided a sample dataset in `.xlsx` format.  
This dataset is synthetically generated and was **not** used in the actual study; it is entirely fictional and intended for illustrative purposes only.

In particular, the sample is designed to help illustrate not only the basic structure of the data, but also how the dataset is organized when ground-truth labels are added by board-certified psychiatrists.
  
In addition, we have included a Python script for generating JSON files suitable for fine-tuning.
