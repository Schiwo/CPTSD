# Extracting Symptoms and Sections

## Overview

This folder contains code to run extraction tasks using OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model with various methods Zero-Shot(zeroshot.py), Zero-shot with RAG(rag.py), In-Context Learning(icl.py).

## Usage

### Zero-Shot

Extract traumatic symptoms and sections from patient interview transcripts without further training.

Meaning of each arguments:<br>
```data``` Data File After Label Extraction with Excel Format <br>
```apikey``` Your openai api key <br>
```result``` Filename of the output generated by GPT <br>
```
python3 zeroshot.py --data=data --apikey=apikey --result=result
```

### Zero-Shot with RAG

Extract traumatic symptoms and sections from patient interview transcripts without further training, using RAG that leverages DSM-5 chapters on Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders.
Please refer to *[the respective paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)* for detailed information on RAG method.

Meaning of each arguments:<br>
```trauma``` Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders chapter of the DSM-5 with PDF Format <br>
```data``` Data File After Label Extraction with Excel Format <br>
```apikey``` Your openai api key <br>
```result``` Filename of the output generated by GPT <br>
```
python3 rag.py --data=data --definition=definition --apikey=apikey --result=result
```

### In-Context Learning

Extract traumatic symptoms and sections from patient interview transcripts with Few-shot In-Context Learning method.
Please refer to *[the respective paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00234)* for detailed information on In-Context Learning method.

Meaning of each arguments:<br>
```data``` Data File After Label Extraction with Excel Format <br>
```examplar``` Examplar File for In-Context Learning with Excel Format <br>
```apikey``` Your openai api key <br>
```result``` Filename of the output generated by GPT <br>
```
python3 icl.py --data=data --apikey=apikey --examplar=examplar --result=result
```
